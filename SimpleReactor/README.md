SimpleReactor
=============

SimpleReactor is an extremely minimal reactor implementation.
It aims at being simple to use and to implement while making it easy to plug into virtually anything.
It suffices to implement two simple interfaces to start using it.

Road plan
---------
Beyond a basic reactor, the aim of SimpleReactor is also to provide plugins to work with common .NET objects that support this pattern (contributions welcome!)
Sub libraries adding support for things like NetMQ, Amazon AWS and other useful libraries to expose IO functions are also planned (again: Contributions welcome!)

Licensing
---------
The SimpleReactor is licensed under the LGPLv3 license.

Contributions
-------------
Contributions are very welcome.
